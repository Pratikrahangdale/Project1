           <strong> Hip-hop</strong> is a high-energy street dance style that originated in the <b>urban neighborhoods</b> of the <strong>United States</strong>. It’s raw, free-spirited, and full of swagger, with moves like popping, locking, and breaking that scream individuality.<br>

<strong>What It Feels Like:</strong> Dancing hip-hop feels like unleashing a fire inside you. It’s bold, edgy, and makes you feel invincible. The beats drive you to push your limits, and every move feels like a statement of who you are.<br>

<strong>Why It’s Unique:</strong> Hip-hop isn’t just a dance; it’s an attitude. It’s about being unapologetically yourself and owning your space. It teaches resilience whether it’s nailing that tricky move or standing tall in the face of challenges. <br>

<strong>Relatable Perspective:</strong> Have you ever felt like you don’t fit in? Hip-hop embraces that. It’s a way to let out your frustrations, channel your energy, and celebrate your individuality. With hip-hop, the streets are your stage, and every move is your voice.
